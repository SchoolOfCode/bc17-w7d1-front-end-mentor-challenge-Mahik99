## PLAN

# HTML

- Add basic HTML boiler plate ✅
- Craete a div with the class `card` to wrap entire content of the preview card ✅
- Add image of perfume- implement semantic HTML eg `<figure>` to wrap image ✅
- Add h1 and h2 for headings, wrap with `<hgroup>` ✅
- Use article tags with a class for the product description ✅
- Specify old and new price by class to style differently in CSS ✅
- `Add  to cart` should be a button with a class - find appropriate cart svg to use ✅

# CSS

- Style the body- white background, 0 margin, use flexbox to center the preview card
- Use grid layout for the preview card? Split into two columns- one for the image on the left and one for the text on the right of the card
- Centre card in the middle of the page
- Use specified fonts and colours listed below
- Individually style h1, h2, p, img elements
- Style the new price to be green and bigger than old price, old price should be grey with a line through it
- Add to cart button- text should be white, bold (700 weight), should have rounded corners (border-radius), add padding too
